# Alien Invasion Game

Welcome to the Alien Invasion game! This project is part of the "Python Crash Course" book by Eric
Matthes, where you get to build your own space-themed shooter game.

### Getting Started

To run the game, you'll need Python 3 and the Pygame library installed on your system. If you haven't
already, you can install Pygame using pip:

    pip install pygame

Once Pygame is installed, you can start the game by running the alien_invasion.py file:

    python alien_invasion.py

## Gameplay

In Alien Invasion, you control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and your objective is to shoot
down the fleet of alien invaders before they reach and destroy your ship. Use the arrow keys to move your spaceship and the space bar to fire bullets.

Watch out for the alien ships' movements and their projectiles! If an alien ship collides with your
spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen, you lose one of your lives. The game ends when all your
lives are depleted.

### Features

- Smooth spaceship movement
- Increasing difficulty as you progress
- Score tracking to keep you motivated

### Controls

- Use the left and right arrow keys to move your spaceship horizontally.
- Press the space bar to shoot bullets at the alien invaders.
- Press 'q' at any time to quit the game.
